Filtering:

Currently there are two forms of filtering: price and brand. Price is filtered
by setting a minimum and maximum price range; brand is filtered by selecting
the brands you want from the checkboxes. If no price is entered or no brands
are selected, nothing is filtered.

Project structure:

The app has 3 core components: CheckboxGroup, ShoeComponent and ShoeList. The
ShoeList is the top level container, and its state includes the original list
of shoes, the current list of shoes and current filter settings. The ShoeComponent
is self-explanatory; it has no state and just renders a shoe. The CheckboxGroup
is a wrapper of sorts, containing a number of checkboxes and maintaining a
dictionary structure to keep track of their status. If a checkbox's status
changes the CheckboxGroup then notifies the ShoeList of the change, and the
ShoeList then filters accordingly.

Originally the CheckboxGroup's state was directly tied to the ShoeList's state
(i.e. there was no notification step); this seemed a lot more elegant and was
more reflective of the app's actual state. However, for some reason this didn't
work; as such the CheckboxGroup has it's own state that in turn updates the
ShoeList's state.
